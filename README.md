# Ruby Exercises

Exercises to practice programming in Ruby.

Here at [CodeUnion][codeunion] we believe that one of the best ways to develop skills as a programmer is to write code and get feedback on your code in the form of a [code review][code-review] from a more experienced programmer.

We wrote these exercises with the intent to give you the opportunity to solve some fun programming challenges and then submit your solutions to us for code review. [Click here to see an example code review][example-code-review].

All of the core exercises can be found in the [exercises](exercises) directory, and bonus exercises (i.e. really tough ones) can be found in the [bonus](bonus) directory.
