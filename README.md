## Series-A and Series-B Kata.

These kata are designed to help you learn to code by challenging you with small, bite sized problems.  If you are unfamiliar with how to 1. obtain a codebase from
Github.com and 2. Edit and run that codebase on your machine, please look at the
tutorial below.  

Our goal with these kata is to provide clear challenges that teach beginners how
to code in ruby.  

We encourage you to get feedback on your code by attending one of our free meetups or emailing us directly
<hello@codeunion.io>.
