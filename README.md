## Series-A and Series-B Kata.

These kata are designed to help you learn to code by challenging you with small, b(y)te sized problems.  If you are unfamiliar with how to 1. Obtain a codebase from
Github.com and 2. Edit and run that code, please use the setup instructions for the [Social-Wall project][social-wall] but use this repository instead.  

Our goal with these kata is to provide clear challenges that teach beginners how
to code in ruby.  

We encourage you to get feedback on your code by attending one of our [free meetups][meetup] or emailing us directly
<hello@codeunion.io>.  

If you like our style, feel free to say hello [@codeunionio][twitters] or [like us on facebook][facebooks].
